# 🖥️ MCPLink - MCP Client-Server Implementation.

A practical implementation of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, showcasing how an LLM can interact with a custom-built **client-server architecture** to execute commands, create files, and generate structured outputs.

This project demonstrates how to:

* Build and run your own MCP **server** and **client**
* Enable LLM-driven **file creation and execution**
* Use prompts to generate **text, code, JSON, and diagrams**
* Integrate **logging** for monitoring and debugging

# ⚙️ Setup

> **Prereqs:** Python 3.10+ and `pip` installed.

## 1) Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-client-server.git
cd mcp/build-your-own-server-client
```

## 2) Server setup (virtualenv + packages)

```bash
cd servers/terminal_server

# Create & activate venv
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (Powershell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

> **Required python packages**

```
mcp        # Model Context Protocol (FastMCP lives under mcp.server.fastmcp)
python-dotenv
```

## 3) Client setup (virtualenv + packages)

```bash
cd ../../clients/mcp-client

# Create & activate venv
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (Powershell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

> **Required python packages**

```
mcp
python-dotenv
rich      # (optional) nicer console output
```

## 4) Environment variables (client)

Create/edit `clients/mcp-client/.env`:

```env
# Example – adjust to your setup
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio
WORKSPACE_ABS_PATH=/absolute/path/to/mcp/build-your-own-server-client/workspace
# LLM keys if your client uses one (optional)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=...
# GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

## 5) Run it (two terminals)

**Terminal A – Server**

```bash
cd mcp/build-your-own-server-client/servers/terminal_server
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
```

**Terminal B – Client**

```bash
cd mcp/build-your-own-server-client/clients/mcp-client
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
```

---

## ✅ Quick sanity test

Once both are running, try these prompts from the client:

* `Create a file named introduction.txt in the workspace and write a short introduction about Large Language Models, explaining their purpose in under 100 words.`
* `Create a file named even_numbers.py to print all even numbers up to 50`
* `Create a file named fruits.json containing a list of at least 5 fruits, where each entry has a name, color, and avg_weight_grams field.`
* `Create a file named flowchart.md containing a Mermaid diagram of the workflow: User → MCP Client → MCP Server → LLM → File Creation.`

---

## 🧹 Git ignore (recommended)

Add this to your repo root `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Python venvs
**/.venv/
# Logs
logs/
*.log
# Local env files
**/.env
__pycache__/
```
