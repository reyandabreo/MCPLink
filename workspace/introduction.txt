Large Language Models are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to perform various tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and content creation. Their primary purpose is to process and produce text in a way that is both coherent and contextually relevant.
